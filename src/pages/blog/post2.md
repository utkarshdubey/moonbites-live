**M.E.M.O.R.I.E.S is based on a beautiful moment where somebody reminisces about their mistakes in the past and tries to think of ways to get over them.**
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey,
<br>
Must be wondering what's this?<br>
Don't worry...<br>
Its for me to reminisce<br>
A reference to what you mean to me,<br>
Incase I ever miscue<br>
I'd have something which I love,<br>
Thoughts about you<br>
I can't hide the fact,<br>
I just can't stop thinking<br>
about the way you smile,<br>
Which is ever convincing<br>
Sometimes I just let it out,<br>
Seems like I'm stupid<br>
When I didn't knew much<br>
Instead looked for the cupid<br>
There's an ecstatic melody,<br>
In each line I wrote<br>
Which only you can understand,<br>
A river where only you float<br>
And when I sink,<br>
Be the light for me<br>
A kiss is only what it takes,<br>
To get me back to the sea<br>
Its been a habit for me,<br>
Another day I've counted<br>
I am starting to get answers<br>
For thoughts I've doubted<br>
To melt into each other,<br>
All I need is a breeze and wet<br>
Ocean side with just you and me,<br>
And a cloudless sky with sunset<br>

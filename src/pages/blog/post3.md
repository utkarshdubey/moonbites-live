**This poem is about a person when he leaves a place and tries to express feelings for his lover about what he felt for her, it beholds a deep meaning.**

<br>
<br>

Since I am leaving,<br>
I think I ought to write this,<br>
A dream you were weaving,<br>
Inside me, full of bliss,<br>
The day you passed by me,<br>
Aware all the pain would ensue,<br>
Kept asking to myself, who was she,<br>
Made the decision I was meant to be with you,<br>
Even though we didn't meet,<br>
Felt like, lived my life with you,<br>
Kept thinking the perfect way to greet,<br>
But didn't got that courage, I knew<br>
Thought of what would it be like,<br>
Spending a day together,<br>
Talk the whole day alike,<br>
And better topics than "Nice weather"!<br>
Riding a unicorn in the sky,<br>
Feeling the wind touching our souls,<br>
And as we dive and fly,<br>
Adding you in the list of my goals,<br>
But all the sweetest ecstasy,<br>
Wasn't around for so long,<br>
My head started filling with a gloomy symphony<br>
Wanted to take you along,<br>
I knew I had to bid adieu,<br>
But not so soon,<br>
I could say that "love is true",<br>
You shall always be my moon,<br>
Let's meet one last time,<br>
Or I'll forever be lonely,<br>
A heart and a rhyme,<br>
You shall always remain my Hermoine.

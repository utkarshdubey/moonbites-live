<br>

**Hope is based on some incidents which happened to me yesterday, it reverberates along some of the lows and worst moments of my life.**
<br>
<br>

<br>
Sitting in a quiet corner,
<br>
What all does he hold?
<br>
An essence of dolour and celerity,
<br>
He does what he's told
<br>
He hides the fervid in disguise
<br>
Illudes it very clear,
<br>
That his life was someone else's choice
<br>
Thus he was rend to bear,
<br>
He felt hopeless hopes
<br>
While his lips trembled,
<br>
A soul betoken<br>
While his demons assembled,<br>
Until that mist touched him<br>
Stop those crescent defeats,<br>
He drowns into a deep slumber<br>
And the cycle repeats.<br>

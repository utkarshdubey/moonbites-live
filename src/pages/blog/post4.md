**Beuatiful Pain is about a heartbroken man meeting his lover on a rainy day trying to even things between them but he fails miserably.**
<br>
<br>

<br>
Once again, <br>
That melancholous rain <br>
Fell on us,<br>
But like pain <br>
And as she waded<br>
And faded,<br>
From my eyes<br>
That sadness gladed<br>
Loneliness and fear<br>
I have to bear,<br>
A harmony of sadness<br>
Is what I hear!<br>
I know she weeps<br>
But still walks away<br>
And shows ease<br>
While I'm on my knees<br>
I scream and shout<br>
Cause there's no her<br>
Undoubtful doubts<br>
I'm broken throughout<br>
Instead of tears,<br>
It's blood flowing<br>
As the memory nears<br>
Of those beautiful years<br>
And as lightning struck me<br>
Those years forgotten <br>
Those memories flee <br>
And it feels I'm free<br>
And as I fly apart <br>
My soul <br>
Throws a dart <br>
Towards a new start<br>
My mind full,<br>
of thoughts as I die<br>
Sometimes light can be dull <br>
And pain can be beautiful. <br>
